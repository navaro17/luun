“Limina” is the name of the great temporary exhibition (09.07 - 30.09) of the internationally recognized and award-winning Greek-Israeli architecture and landscape photographer Erieta Attali. After 30 years, she returns to the Byzantine and Christian Museum, paying tribute to this special place where she once did her internship. The present photo exhibition of Attali entitled "Limina", includes eighteen (18) selected large photographs where architecture is an essential element of the landscape. Photographs are displayed on the ground floor of the Palace of the Duchess of Placentia as well as on the outer walls around the main courtyard of the Museum.
