The Panhellenic Association of Landscape Architects is organising two circle webinars, in English and Greek, aiming to tackle the EU green deal challenges and to present new trends towards biodiversity recognition as a source for sustainable economy and development, nature-based solutions, climate change mitigation measures and circular economy as a framework to enhance economic and environmental resilience.
