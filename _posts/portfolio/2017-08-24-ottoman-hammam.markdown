The Ottoman city of Sidirokausia flourished between the 15th and the 17th centuries at the west side of the modern village of Stageira in Chalcidice. One of the public buildings of the city, which was preserved in a very good condition, is the hammam. Ishak Paşa, a grand Vizier and later on a Vali of Thessaloniki, founded the hammam, probably before 1487, and the income was addressed in the establishment of Alaca Imaret in Thessaloniki. The Ephorate of Antiquities of Chalcidice and Mount Athos carried out the conservation works at the bath in the framework of the programme “Macedonia-Thrace 2007-2013”.
