The landscape lighting design for this house in northeastern Crete balances functionality and aesthetics, creating a warm and inviting outdoor space. By incorporating low light levels, the design promotes a soothing atmosphere that highlights the natural beauty of the surroundings. The illumination of water elements adds a touch of tranquility, while diffused lighting without hotspots ensures a soft glow that minimizes glare. Careful attention is given to illuminating the jambs and heads of openings, enhancing the architectural features and showcasing the rich stone texture. Strategically positioned lights also accentuate the graceful olive trees, blending seamlessly with the serene landscape.
