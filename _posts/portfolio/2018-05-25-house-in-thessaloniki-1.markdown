Greek Architectural Studio 406architects has renovated a 2010 semi â€“ complete existing private house, located within a housing development in the outskirts of the City of Thessaloniki, Greece, adding a contemporary use to the existing housing structure. Lighting for the new house is been kept discreet without been uniform, thus adding intensity to the space at night with the use of accent lighting and design items that complement and give a characteristic appearance to the new interior.
