Researchers believe that the two exceptional [Roman mosaics](https://cutt.ly/WmoaAyy) (the Abduction of Europa and Orpheus with the Animals) hosted at the House of the Mosaics in Sparta, were part of the decoration of a bath complex. It is also possible that the bath infrastructure and mosaics were part of a rich Roman house, or two neighbouring ones. Uncovered in 1872 and 1877, they date to around 300 AD and are distinguished for their composition, rich colours, and craftsmanship.
