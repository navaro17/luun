If your question isn’t covered, feel free to reach out at welcome [at] luun [dot] gr.</p> <h3 id="general">General</h3> <dl> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">What is LUUN?</dt> <dd>If we had to define our work in one sentence, it would be: “End-to-end solutions for lighting projects.”</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">What does “LUUN” stand for?</dt> <dd>LUUN is an original brand name, designed to look and sound symmetrical, reminiscent of various words related to “lux”, which is Latin for light, beginning with the prefix “lu —”, such as luminous, lumen, luna, and luminaire.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">What is architectural lighting?</dt> <dd>Architectural lighting focuses on illuminating the built environment, both indoors and outdoors. It primarily involves the installation of permanent lighting systems for functional and aesthetic purposes.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Who are your clients and what kind of projects do you undertake?</dt> <dd>Our core clientele consists of architects, interior designers, landscape designers, lighting designers, engineers, constructors, and private individuals. We work on a wide range of projects, including residences, office spaces, retail stores, restaurants, hotels, museums, public spaces, archaeological sites, churches and other worship places.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Do you have a retail store?</dt> <dd>No, our business operates on a project-driven (contract) model. While we don’t have a retail store, we do have a showroom where clients can see and test materials before making decisions.</dd> </dl> <h3 id="design">Study</h3> <dl> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Free vs paid design service</dt> <dd>In architectural lighting, product sales require a study to ensure both technical performance and aesthetic quality. If a client does not already have a lighting study, LUUN typically provides one free of charge. However, the key difference between this complimentary service and a commissioned study lies in the level of analysis and deliverables. A purchased study, conducted by specialized professionals, offers a more in-depth and comprehensive approach. For more complex and large-scale projects, investing in a paid study by a lighting designer is essential to achieving optimal results. Please feel free to ask us for further information and recommendations.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Is electrical design included in your studies?</dt> <dd>No. Lighting design focuses on defining light point groupings and suggesting lighting scenes. However, the electrical engineer is responsible for calculations related to cabling, load distribution, electrical panels, and other technical aspects of the electrical system.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Can you give me a reliable preview of the final lighting result?</dt> <dd>Yes. Beyond numbers, diagrams, and technical details—which can sometimes be difficult to interpret—we provide a highly reliable visualization of how your space, facade, or landscape will look like with the lights on.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">When is the best time to prepare a lighting design?</dt> <dd>The ideal time is after the architectural design is complete, but before construction begins. This helps prevent mistakes and allows for significant cost savings.</dd> </dl> <h3 id="pre-sales">Pre-sales</h3> <dl> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Why shouldn't I choose the lighting for my space on my own or rely solely on my electrician?</dt> <dd>Quick and easy choices can lead to disappointing results. Don’t forget that lighting affects both vision and mood. So proper lighting enhances comfort and well-being, creating a space that feels as good as it looks.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Why shouldn’t I just buy cheap copies of the lights you’ve suggested?</dt> <dd>We could give you a hundred reasons not to, but others might give you just as many reasons for doing so. The real question is: would you buy a CD from a street vendor, a cheap imitation of designer clothing, or a fake watch? If your answer is yes, then buying cheap copies of the lights we’ve suggested might seem like a good option for you. However, we believe that investing in quality leads to better performance and longer-lasting results.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Will I save energy?</dt> <dd>Definitely. LUUN always takes that factor into account and not just in terms of installing equipment with a low energy footprint. Don’t forget that you can have significant energy savings from a proper layout and the installation of just the right number of lights.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Can the lighting be centrally and remotely controlled, allowing me to dim, program light points, or create preset scenes?</dt> <dd>Absolutely. Ask us about lighting control systems. They're easy to install and, with today’s technology, incredibly user-friendly, offering full control over your lighting setup.</dd> </dl> <h3 id="sales">Sales</h3> <dl> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">What does a lighting consultant do?</dt> <dd>Lighting consultants are responsible for guiding your project from start to finish, ensuring it meets your specific needs. They listen to your requirements, oversee the design process, place the order, and, in many cases, supervise the installation. They also handle any challenges that may arise throughout the project, ensuring everything runs smoothly.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">What’s your pricing policy?</dt> <dd>The manufacturers we collaborate with have a standard price list across the European Union, meaning you’ll find the same product at the same retail price in any EU country. However, each agent offers discounts, which can be partially passed on to customers.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Why can’t I get a huge discount like the one another company offered me?</dt> <dd>Simply put, LUUN avoids misleading commercial tactics, such as inflating prices just to offer large discounts. We believe in fair, transparent pricing that reflects the true value of our products and services.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Why is the exact same product cheaper in e-shops?</dt> <dd>This is expected, as e-shops have lower overhead costs compared to an architectural lighting firm, which invests in staff, showrooms, and specialized services. However, unlike e-shops, we provide expert guidance, personalized support, and tailored lighting solutions to ensure the best results for your project.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">How long does it take for the lighting products to arrive after I place an order?</dt> <dd>In most cases, delivery takes no more than two weeks. However, in some instances, it may take up to four to five weeks, depending on the specific products and supplier availability.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Is there a wide range of products available? Are the products sufficient to cover the needs of every project?</dt> <dd>Our primary objective is to work in partnership with manufacturers, in order to cover the greatest possible range of lighting applications.</dd> </dl> <h3 id="after-sales">After-sales</h3> <dl> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Do you also install the lighting?</dt> <dd>No, but we can recommend specialized teams who can handle the installation for you.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">My product is defective! What happens now?</dt> <dd>LUUN collaborate with trusted European manufacturers to ensure the highest product quality. However, occasional defects can occur, whether in mass-produced items or even the most sophisticated handmade pieces. If the defect is due to a manufacturing error, we will ensure the product is replaced as quickly as possible.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">What guarantee do the products come with?</dt> <dd>It depends on the manufacturer, but the standard warranty is typically 5 years.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">I can’t get used to the new lighting! What’s going on?</dt> <dd>If there’s no obvious issue, such as intense glare, and you’re simply having trouble adjusting, it’s likely that everything is functioning as it should. Keep in mind that your brain needs time to adapt to new lighting conditions. After a few days, the lighting will feel more natural, and you’ll be able to appreciate the benefits of the new lighting scheme.</dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">Can I return products that I don’t want to keep for any reason?</dt> <dd>Unfortunately, we do not accept returns.</dd> </dl> <h3 id="other">Other</h3> <dl> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">What’s your opinion on the numerous cheap products flooding the market?</dt> <dd>We don’t have an issue with affordability—cheap products don’t always mean poor quality. However, it’s important to remember that good design is always honest and built to last. As Aldo Gucci wisely said, “The bitterness of poor quality is remembered long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten.” Quality and longevity are what truly matter in the end. </dd> <dt style="font-weight: 500;">What’s your opinion on the holistic approach to lighting that various companies promise?</dt> <dd>Without generalizing, Katie Henderson (@hondohondohondo) put it perfectly when she said: “Holistic approach: Let us do everything for you, we need the money.” </dd> </dl> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/luun/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
